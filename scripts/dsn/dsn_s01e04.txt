2    INT. CLOSE ON AIRLOCK GATE

	Three newly arrive visitors to DS Nine (one Bajoran national,
	one human and one N.D. alien) are trapped inside the airlock.
	They bang their fists in frustration against the window.
	O'BRIEN, looking tired and harried, stands on the other side
	of the gate, trying to placate them.

					O'BRIEN
			Look, save your energy.  We'll have
			you out of there as soon as possible.
				(muttering under his
				breath)
			I hope.

	He turns toward his repair crew (two humans) who are working
	inside an open panel.

					O'BRIEN
			Try re-routing the power coupling...

	And hand reaches into frame and taps O'Brien impatiently on
	the shoulder.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - TEASER              2.

2    CONTINUED:

					JAHEEL (V.O.)
			Mister O'Brien...

					O'BRIEN
				(to repair crew;
				ignoring the tap.)
			... See if you can activate the
			interlock servos.

	Another shoulder tap.  This time even more insistent.

					JAHEEL (V.O.)
			Mister O'Brien...

	An annoyed O'Brien turns to confront CAPTAIN JAHEEL, a wiry
	bearded alien.

					O'BRIEN
			Captain, Jaheel, those people have
			been stuck in that air lock for over
			an hour.  Now if you'll just wait
			until we get that door opened, I'll
			be happy to discuss any problem you
			might have.

					JAHEEL
			But I've already been waiting two
			days for your people to readjust my
			ship's antimatter flow converter.

					O'BRIEN
			I'm afraid we've fallen a bit behind
			in our maintenance schedule.

					JAHEEL
			I'm not interested in hearing excuses.
			I have a shipment of Tamen Sasheer
			waiting to be delivered to Largo
			Five, and I'll need to do better
			than warp one to get there before it
			spoils.

					O'BRIEN
			I'll try to get a repair crew on it
			before the end of the day.  Now that's
			the best I can do.

					JAHEEL
			Your best, Mister O'Brien, hardly
			seems good enough.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - TEASER              3.

2    CONTINUED:	(2)

	Jaheel turns and storms away leaving behind a scowling
	O'Brien.

					DAX'S COM VOICE
			Dax to O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN
				(taps combadge)
			O'Brien here.

					DAX
			Can you spare a minute, Chief.  I
			have a little problem here at the
			lab.

	O'Brien glances over at the repair crew.  He figures they
	can handle things at this end.

					O'BRIEN
			On my way.

3    INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE LABORATORY

	DAX stands by the laboratory door as O'Brien approaches.

					DAX
			Thanks for coming, Chief.

					O'BRIEN
			What are you doing out here?

	Dax answers by touching the door's entry panel.  The door
	slides open and we are assaulted by a LOUD CACOPHONOUS WHINE
	BLARING from within the room.

4    INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS

	Dax and O'Brien have to shout to be heard above the noise.

					O'BRIEN
			Have you checked the EPS convertor?

					DAX
			Yes.  First thing.

					O'BRIEN
			How about the intensity grid?

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - TEASER              4.

4    CONTINUED:

					DAX
				(nodding)
			It's fine.

					O'BRIEN
			Then it's probably the secondary
			phase modulator.  We had trouble
			with them last week in the main power
			core.

	He opens up a panel.  Makes some adjustments.

					O'BRIEN
			This should do it.

	The noise abruptly stops.  At the same moment lights go out,
	plunging the room into utter darkness.  A beat, then...

					O'BRIEN (V.O.)
			Anything else I can do for you?

5    INT. OPS

	Close on KIRA who leans over her desk console as she talks
	to someone O.S.

					KIRA
			The navigational computer hasn't
			been working reliably for three days.
			I ask for the star charts of the
			Argosian sector and the Glessene
			sector comes up instead.

	Pan down to REVEAL O'Brien half buried in an open panel.

					O'BRIEN
			Uh-huh.

					KIRA
			That's when I can even coax the system
			on line.

					O'BRIEN
			Try it now.

	Kira taps a control panel.  The console lights up.

					KIRA
				(pleased)
			That's more like it.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - TEASER              5.

5    CONTINUED:

	O'Brien sighs.  Another victory for the good guys.
	Wearily, he closes the panel and gets to his feet.

					KIRA
			You look like you could use some

			sleep.

					O'BRIEN
			Who has time for sleep... ?

	In the background SISKO stands before a food replicator.

					SISKO
				(to replicator)
			Coffee.

	O'Brien sits down at Kira's station.

					O'BRIEN
			I'd settle for five minutes of peace
			and quiet.

	Sisko takes his first deep sip of Java... and nearly gags...
	it's awful.

					SISKO
			Chief, I thought you were going to
			fix the replicators.

	O'Brien shoots Kira a long suffering look as he hauls himself
	out of the seat.

					O'BRIEN
				(to Sisko, emphatic)
			You're absolutely right, Sir.  I
			knew I'd forgotten something.  Can't
			have the operations chief sitting
			around daydreaming when there's work
			to be done, can we?  I'll get right
			on it.

	He EXITS.  Sisko looks over at Kira.  What's his problem?

6    INT. CORRIDOR/ACCESS TUNNEL (OPTICAL)

	O'Brien lies on his back in an access tunnel, grumbling as
	he works on the circuitry with various tools.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - TEASER              6.

6    CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			Fix the Replicators, Chief... My
			console's off line, Chief... I
			should've transferred to a cargo
			drone... no people, no complaints...

	He completes the repair and moves out of the tunnel and into
	the corridor.  There's a small REPLICATOR UNIT in the wall.
	He touches the panel... and the entire display BLACKS OUT...
	a BRIGHT ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE envelopes the panel.

	O'Brien steps back, startled.  Now what's going on?  Suddenly,
	the DISCHARGE DISAPPEARS... the panel looks completely normal
	again.

	O'Brien scans the unit with his tricorder... there's nothing
	wrong with it.  He scowls.

					O'BRIEN
				(touches panel)
			Hot coffee black, double sweet.

	A steaming mug of coffee MATERIALIZES.  O'Brien picks it up
	and takes a wary sip.  A smile breaks slowly across his
	face... it's delicious.  Finally, something's working.

7    INT. REPLICATOR

	Camera looking out through the open panel at O'Brien.  He
	takes a big gulp from the MUG and CLOSES THE PANEL, we HEAR
	HIM EXIT down the corridor, whistling.  Hold a beat... then
	as music builds ominously the camera pans along the replicator
	circuitry... coming to rest on...

8    OMITTED

8A   AN ALIEN DEVICE

	attached to the circuitry.  As the camera pushes in closer
	the device suddenly activates... a LIGHT PULSATING on and
	off to eerie effect.  Whatever this thing is, it definitely
	doesn't belong here.

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	(Note:  Episode credits fall over opening scenes)

9    INT. QUARK'S

	ODO observes the premises from his seat at the bar.  Actually
	there's not much to see... only three or four customers in
	the entire place.  Odo seems quite pleased at the lack of
	activity, an attitude in sharp contrast to QUARK who appears
	positively morose as he wipes down the bar counter top.

					ODO
			Tell me, Quark, am I mistaken or is
			business a little slow today?

					QUARK
			Slow?  It's been almost nonexistent
			for the past three days.

					ODO
			Who knows, if things don't improve
			you may have to close down altogether.

					QUARK
			You'd like that, wouldn't you?

					ODO
			Let's just say that without you
			around, my job would be considerably
			easier.

					QUARK
			Without me around you'd be forced to
			find some other, poor innocent to
			persecute.  Think about that while
			you sit here gloating at my
			misfortune.

					ASOTH (V.O.)
			Quark!

	Angle to include ASOTH, who slams his food bowl onto the bar.

					ASOTH
			You call this Kohlanese stew?

	Confronted by the large, angry alien, Quark turns on his
	most obsequious charm.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT ONE             8.

9    CONTINUED:

					QUARK
			If your meal isn't satisfactory I'm
			sure we could exchange it for
			something more to your liking.

	Asoth grabs Quark by the collar.

					ASOTH
			Aren't you the least bit curious how
			it tastes?

	He spoons up some of the stew and shoves it into Quark's
	mouth.  Quark takes one bite... and immediately spits out
	the hideous tasting gruel.

					ASOTH
			Oh no you don't.  You served it.
			You're going to eat it.

	He scoops up another spoonful.  Odo appears behind him.
	Places a restraining hand on his shoulder.

					ODO
			All right.  That's enough.

	Ignoring Odo, Asoth tries thrusting the spoon between Quark's
	lips.

					ASOTH
			You heard me.  Eat.

	Odo's hand clamps down on Asoth's shoulder.  The Alien drops
	this spoon and grunts in pain.

					ODO
				(quiet authority)
			I said leave him alone.

	Asoth nods in agreement.  Odo releases him.  Clutching his
	shoulder the Alien beats a hasty retreat.

					ODO
				(watching him exit)
			Another satisfied customer.

	Quark glares at the bar's replicator unit.

					QUARK
			It's these replicators.  If I don't
			get them repaired soon, they'll
			destroy my business.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT ONE             9.

9    CONTINUED:	(2)

					ODO
			Why not get O'Brien to fix them.  He
			has the replicators on the command
			level working perfectly.


	Quark's eyes narrow.  This is news to him.

					QUARK
			I'm on his waiting list.  He assures
			me he'll get to them as soon as he
			can.

					ODO
			No telling when that will be.  The
			Chief's a very busy man.

	Odo EXITS.

10   ANGLE QUARK

	Who immediately moves to a computer panel behind the bar.

					QUARK
			Computer... display a station layout.
			Highlight locations of all repaired
			replicators on the command level.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Information restricted to security
			clearance five and above.  Please
			enter security verification.

	Quark pulls out a drawer full of the Cardassian equivalent
	to isolinear chips.  He counts off five of them... pulls out
	the fifth one... places it into the computer panel.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Clearance verified.

	The computer displays a graphic of the station plans,
	indicating several locations.  Quark studies the layout, a
	self-satisfied grin on his face.

11   INT. OPS

	Close on O'Brien's hand removing a coffee cup from inside
	the replicator.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/16/92 - ACT ONE            10.

12   ANGLE

	As O'Brien passes the coffee to SISKO --

					O'BRIEN
			Here you go, Sir.  I think you'll
			find it more to your liking.

	Sisko takes a sip.  Smiles.

					SISKO
			Much appreciated, Mister O'Brien.

					O'BRIEN
			Don't mention it, Sir.  Unfortunately,
			there are still plenty of replicators
			around the station that need looking
			after...

	O'Brien mops at his brow.

					SISKO
			You all right, Chief?

					O'BRIEN
			Bit warm, that's all.  Environmental
			controls must be acting up again.

	O'Brien starts away but is stopped by Sisko.

					SISKO
			Please send my regards to Mrs.
			O'Brien.  Jake tells me she's a
			wonderful teacher.

					O'BRIEN
			That's nice to hear, Sir.  She's
			flower units about the lad herself.

					SISKO
				(sure he's misheard)
			Excuse me?

					O'BRIEN
				(confused)
			Sir?

					SISKO
			What was that you just said?

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT ONE           10A.

12   CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			She's quite fond of the lad herself.

	It's a weird moment... but Sisko lets it go.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT ONE            11.

12   CONTINUED:	(2)

					SISKO
			Glad to hear it.


					O'BRIEN
			Very good, Sir.

	A somewhat perplexed O'Brien heads back to his station.

13   INT. PROMENADE

	Dax and Kira, off duty, are strolling through the complex.
	A BAJORAN SECURITY GUARD passes by and shoots Dax a warm
	smile.

					BAJORAN SECURITY GUARD
			Lieutenant Dax.

	She returns the smile.  An alien BUSINESSMAN comes out of a
	shop and nods pleasantly.

					BUSINESSMAN
			Ladies.

	Dax and Kira nod back.  A few more steps and they encounter
	a STARFLEET CREWMEMBER.  He grins boyishly at Dax.

					STARFLEET MALE
			Hello, Lieutenant.

	Dax smiles.  She looks over at Kira.  They share a laugh.

					DAX
			I'd forgotten how different it was.

					KIRA
			How different what was?

					DAX
			Being female.  I haven't been one
			for over eighty years.

	She reacts to another smile from a friendly passerby.

					DAX
			All this attention.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT ONE            12.

13   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			I imagine it must take some getting
			use to.

					DAX
			Actually I find it quite enjoyable.

					QUARK (V.O.)
			Major Kira... Lieutenant Dax...

14   ANGLE ON QUARK

	Leaning against the part of the bar counter facing the
	Promenade.  Behind him, we see that business has picked up
	considerably.  Customers are eating and drinking with gusto.

					QUARK
			I'd be honored to have you join my
			little party.  As my guests, of
			course.

					KIRA
			What's all this, Quark?  You cheat
			your one-thousandth customer?

	Quark lets loose with an insincere laugh... quickly replaced
	by a sharp glare toward Kira.

					QUARK
			Who says Bajorans have no sense of
			humor?
				(pointing to the
				activity taking place
				behind him)
			Actually we're celebrating the repair
			of the bar's replicator system.
				(to Dax)
			Perhaps I could interest you in a
			nice double-whipped I'danian spice
			pudding.

					DAX
				(to Kira; tempted)
			What do you think?

					KIRA
			I think I'm due back at Ops.  But go
			on, enjoy yourself.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT ONE            13.

14   CONTINUED:

	Kira EXITS.  Dax looks over at Quark who anxiously awaits
	her decision.  Dax shrugs why not.  She moves toward the
	doorway.

15   INT. QUARK'S - CONTINUOUS

	Dax ENTERS.  She makes her way over to the bar where Quark
	is giving the bum's rush to a customer in order to make room
	for her.  He fawningly escorts her to a seat.

					QUARK
				(exaggerated courtesy)
			Please, make yourself comfortable,
			Lieutenant.  I did say a double
			whipped spice pudding, didn't I?

	From beneath the counter he pulls out an outrageously caloric
	dessert.  Places it in front of Dax.

					DAX
			It's lovely.  I almost hate to eat
			it.

					QUARK
			By all means, take the time to admire
			its beauty... While I admire yours.

15A  INT. OPS - CLOSE ON O'BRIEN

	at his station.  Looking sweaty and pale.  He steadies himself
	against a console; tries to clear his head.

15B  ANGLE WIDENS

	to include a concerned Kira.

					KIRA
			Chief... ?

					O'BRIEN
				(trying to cover, but
				failing)
			How can I help you, Major?

	She touches his brow.

					KIRA
			You're the one who could use a little
			help.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT ONE            14.

15B  CONTINUED:

					O'BRIEN
			I'm fine, really.

					KIRA
			I guess this isn't a good time to
			tell you the number three Turbolift
			has broken down again.

	O'Brien gives Kira a puzzled look.

					KIRA
			I'm joking, Chief.
				(Note: From here on
				dialogue spoken by
				characters with
				aphasia will appear
				as gibberish in the
				script.  A translation
				will be provided

					O'BRIEN
			Major.  Cat's lark pepper.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/19/92 - ACT ONE            15.

15B  CONTINUED:  (2)

					KIRA
			What?

					O'BRIEN
				(frustration building)
			Let birds go further loose maybe.
			Shout easy play.

					KIRA
			Chief, you're not making any sense.

	An agitated O'Brien, struggles to make himself understood.

					O'BRIEN
			Round the turbulent quick.

	A worried Kira shakes her head.

					O'BRIEN
			Close the reverse harbor.

	By now, the rest of the Ops crew is staring at O'Brien,
	wondering what's going on.

					O'BRIEN
				(shouting at them)
			Ankle try sound reset gleaming?

	Realizing he still isn't getting through to anyone O'Brien
	heads for the Turbolift.

					O'BRIEN

	FADE IN:

17   INT. INFIRMARY

	O'Brien is seated on the diagnostic bed, as BASHIR examines
	his eyes with a sophisticated scanner.

					BASHIR
			Computer continue neural imaging
			scan.  Stimulate visual cortex.

	A beat, as the scanner runs through its tests.  Then --

					COMPUTER VOICE
			All visual responses normal.

18   ANGLE WIDENS - TO INCLUDE KIRA AND NURSE JABARA

	Bashir crosses to a work station and grabs a piece of Med
	tech which he places over O'Brien's ears.

					BASHIR
			Computer begin auditory stimuli.

	Another series of tests are completed.  Then --

					COMPUTER VOICE
			No physiological damage.  All brain
			functions within normal parameters.

	Bashir removes the equipment.  He's clearly puzzled by the
	results.

					BASHIR
				(a thoughtful beat)
			Nurse, pull up Mister O'Brien's neuro-
			physiological history.

					NURSE JABARA
			Yes, Doctor.

	She seats herself at a work station and begins accessing the
	information.  Mister O'Brien looks at Bashir and knows the
	diagnosis isn't good.  He gets up and grabs a PADD, punches
	in a message which he pushes toward the Doctor.

	The screen is filled with gibberish.

20   RESUME SCENE

	O'Brien's desperation building.  He feels trapped and alone.

					O'BRIEN
				(exasperated)
			Flame the dark true salt.

	Bashir tries to gently direct him back to the bed.

					BASHIR
			Please, Chief, have a seat.

	O'Brien pushes away.

					O'BRIEN
			Way link complete.  Way link.

	Kira touches his shoulder.  He whirls around.  Their eyes
	lock in silent sympathetic communication.  He allows her to
	lead him to the bed.

					KIRA
				(to Bashir)
			What's wrong with him?

					BASHIR
			He appears to be suffering from a
			form of aphasia.  It's a perceptual
			dysfunction in which aural and visual
			stimuli are incorrectly processed by
			the brain.  His actual thinking hasn't
			been affected.  But he's incapable
			of expressing himself or understanding
			others.

					O'BRIEN
				(despairing)
			Strike limits victory frosted wake.
			Simple hesitation.

21   INT. OPS

	Sisko, Bashir, Dax and Kira at the operations table.

					SISKO
			I'm not sure I follow you, Doctor.
			You say Mister O'Brien is aphasic,
			but all of his tests come up negative.

	Dax wipes her forehead; she appears a bit flushed.

					DAX
				(to Bashir)
			Isn't aphasia typically associated
			with some kind of cranial trauma?

					BASHIR
			Yes.  It can occur as a result of a
			stroke or blow to the head.  But
			there's no evidence of that here.

					DAX
			Have you checked the medical library
			for precedents?

					BASHIR
			And re-checked.  Nothing so far.

					SISKO
			Have you any theories?

	A hard admission for Bashir.

					BASHIR
			Not yet.

					SISKO
			Find one.
				(to Kira)
			Major, get hold of the Chief's
			personal duty log.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT TWO            19.

					SISKO
			I want to know where he's been and
			what he's done for the past fifty-

					KIRA
			I've already examine it, Commander.
			He's been all over this station.

					SISKO
			Retrace his steps.  See what you
			come up with.
				(a beat)
			Dax, you will temporarily assume
			Mister O'Brien's duties.

	Dax's face is slick with perspiration.  She appears slightly
	disoriented.

					DAX
			Yes... I'll...

	The others are now aware of her discomfort.

					SISKO
			Is there a problem, Lieutenant?

	Dax stares blankly at him.

					SISKO
			Lieutenant.

	Dax forces herself to speak calmly and deliberately.

					DAX
			I'm sorry, Benjamin, but... I'm unable

23   INT. INFIRMARY - DAY TWO

	Sisko and Bashir are at a wall monitor studying an Okudagram
	which details a virus-like organism.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT TWO            20.

23   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			Commander, spontaneous development
			of aphasia is virtually impossible.
			But we saw Lieutenant Dax become
			aphasic before our eyes.  That told
			me we were dealing with a disease
			that only mimics aphasia.  So I ran
			a full neuro-synaptic comparison of
			Dax and O'Brien.
				(pointing to monitor)
			And found this in the temporal lobes
			of both patients.

					SISKO
			A virus?

					BASHIR
				(nods)
			It imposes itself within established
			synaptic pathways and then randomly
			reroutes them.  For example, when I
			look at this...
				(picks up tricorder)
			... a process occurs in my brain which
			connects this stimulus to the word
			"tricorder."  The virus disrupts
			that process.

					SISKO
			I'd see the tricorder but I would
			say something ridiculous like...
			window.

					BASHIR
			Exactly.

	Suddenly we HEAR a BABBLE OF VOICES from behind them.

23A  NEW ANGLE

	Sisko and Bashir turn to see NURSE JABARA and two STARFLEET
	CREWMEMBERS at the doorway.

					NURSE JABARA
			Doctor, I think you better get over
			here.

	Sisko and Bashir walk over and are immediately confronted by
	the crewmembers, both talking at once... and making no sense
	at all.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT TWO            21.

23A  CONTINUED:

24   INT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

25   INT. PROMENADE - ANGLE ON ODO

	As he exits Turbolift.  He glances up and down the street,
	which is deserted except for two passersby.  Odo is about to
	reenter the Turbolift to continue his rounds, when he hears
	noise coming from Quark's.  He goes to investigate.

26   INT. QUARKS

	Surprisingly busy, Odo ENTERS, takes one look at the crowd,
	and makes a bee line for Quark, who is behind the bar.

					ODO
			Quark, what is going on here?

					QUARK
			What's it look like?

					ODO
			It looks like business as usual.
			But that's impossible, because all
			shops and business have been closed
			until further notice.

					QUARK
			Except, of course, for essential
			station operations.

					ODO
			For which this place hardly qualifies.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT TWO            22.

26   CONTINUED:

	Quark eyes the house.

					QUARK
			I don't think they would agree.
			This quarantine has everyone on
			edge, Constable.  Would you deprive
			them of a little harmless diversion?

					ODO
			They'd be safer in their quarters.

	Asoth passes by.

					ASOTH
			Quark, that Kohlanese stew...
			magnificent.

	Quark nods modestly, then notices Odo's questioning look.

					QUARK
			Fortunately my assistant, Rom, was
			able to fix the replicators.

					ODO
			Yes, very fortunate.

	But Odo's suspicions have been raised.

27   INT. PROMENADE SECOND LEVEL

	CAMERA PANS along the empty corridor until it comes to rest
	on JAKE, who leans against the railing, looking down at the
	street below.

					SISKO (V.O.)
			Jake!

	Jake's head snaps up... sees his father headed his way.

					SISKO
				(an angry parent)
			I expected you home an hour ago.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT TWO            23.

27   CONTINUED:

					JAKE
			Sorry.  I was over at Nog's.

	They start down the staircase.

					JAKE
			Dad, about this quarantine, it's
			going to be okay, isn't it?

					SISKO
				(reassuring)
			It's just a precaution.  Nothing
			more.

28   INT. PROMENADE - FIRST LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

	They reach the bottom of the stairs only to find an anxious
	Captain Jaheel waiting for them.

					JAHEEL
			I wish I shared your confidence
			Commander.

	Sisko gives Jake an encouraging pat.

					SISKO
			Go on home, son.  I'll see you at
			dinner.

	Jake EXITS - Sisko watches him go then turns a disapproving
	eye towards Jaheel.

					SISKO
			Captain Jaheel, all visitors have
			been confined to their ships.

					JAHEEL
			Believe me, there is no place I'd
			rather be.

					SISKO
			Then what are you doing here?

					JAHEEL
			Searching for you.  Commander, I
			officially request permission to
			leave this station.

	Sisko's response is immediate and leaves no room for doubt.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT TWO            24.

					SISKO
			Request denied.

					JAHEEL
			But none of my crew has been affected
			by this virus of yours, and unless I
			depart at once my entire cargo will
			be ruined...

					SISKO
				(an order)
			Captain, I suggest you return to
			your ship.  Now.

					JAHEEL
				(urgent)
			Please... I don't want to get sick.

	Sisko's tone softens as he realizes Jaheel is terrified of
	the virus.

					SISKO
			I'm sorry, but until we find a cure
			for this thing no one's going
			anywhere.

	A beat.  Then mustering up his remaining dignity Jaheel nods
	and EXITS.

	Hold on Sisko's reaction.

29   INT. CORRIDOR

	Quark pushes a small cart along the passageway.

29A  ANGLE

	as he stops in front of a door with a Starfleet logo
	prominently displayed.  He checks the corridor -- it's clear.
	He taps a code into a Ferengi PADD.  We HEAR A CLICK; the
	door OPENS and he ENTERS.

30   INT. EMPTY CREW QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	The room is dark.  Quark moves quickly to the replicator,
	checks a PADD.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT TWO           24A.

					QUARK
			Let's start with one Ferengi
			Stardrifter, please.  Extra strong.

	The goblet sized drink MATERIALIZES.  Quark turns to place
	it on the cart -- which suddenly MORPHS into Odo.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT TWO            25.

30   CONTINUED:

	A startled Quark drops the glass, but quickly regains his
	wits.  After all he's been playing "games" like this with
	Odo for many years.

					QUARK
			I thought the front wheels were
			sticking a bit.

					ODO
			Unauthorized access to crew quarters
			is a crime, Quark.
				(a beat)
			You could have just asked to use the
			replicators.

					QUARK
			There's an old Ferengi saying, "Never
			ask when you can take."
				(trying to hide his
				annoyance)
			How did you figure it out, anyway?

					ODO
			You claimed Rom fixed your
			replicators.

					QUARK
			So?

					ODO
			Rom's an idiot.  He couldn't fix a
			straw if it was bent.

	As he leads Quark out of the room.

					QUARK
			You're right.  He is an idiot.  Remind
			me to get rid of him tomorrow.

31   INT. OPS

	Sisko, Bashir, and Kira at the operations table.

					BASHIR
			Based on the levels of the virus
			found in the patients' blood, I believe
			it's being absorbed through ingestion.

					SISKO
			You're saying it's in our food?

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT TWO           25A.

31   CONTINUED:

					KIRA
			That's not possible.  All the food
			on the station is replicated and all
			the replicators use bio-filters.
			They automatically screen out
			contaminants, including viruses.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/07/92 - ACT TWO            26.

31   CONTINUED:

					BASHIR
			Major, I have analyzed samples from
			all over the station.  All of the
			food on the command level is
			contaminated with the virus.

					SISKO
			But all of us here have eaten from
			those replicators.  How come we're
			not aphasic?

					BASHIR
			This virus is highly adaptable.  Its
			gestation period seems to vary within
			each individual.

	Both Sisko and Kira consider this news for a beat.

					KIRA
			According to O'Brien's duty log the
			last thing he did before become
			aphasic was fix the command level
			replicators.  But I had a repair
			crew inspect the site.  They found
			nothing suspicious.

					SISKO
			Look again.  Closer.

	Kira nods.

					SISKO
				(continuing, to Bashir)
			Let's shut down the command level
			replicators.  At the very least we
			can contain this thing.

					BASHIR
			I'm not sure that's going to do it,
			sir.  I've been getting aphasic
			patients from all over the station...

					SISKO
			But how is that possible...

					ODO (O.S.)
			You can thank Quark.

32   ANGLE TO INCLUDE ODO

	as he joins the group.

             DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/15/92 - ACT TWO            27.

32   CONTINUED:

					ODO
			I caught him using a replicator in
			one of the vacant crew quarters.  He
			was producing his entire menu out of
			there.

					SISKO
			And contaminating all his customers.

	A long beat as the implications sink in.  Bashir takes a
	reading with his medical tricorder --

					BASHIR
			If this virus is present in a large
			enough segment of the population, it
			could mean...

	Bashir rises.

33   NEW ANGLE

	As he quickly crosses over to Dax's station.  He feeds the
	information from the tricorder into a monitor.

					SISKO
			What is it, Doctor?

					BASHIR
			I just took an air sample.

34   INSERT MONITOR

	We recognize the same organism we saw earlier in the
	Infirmary.

35   RESUME SCENE

	Sisko recognizes it too.

					SISKO
			The virus?

					BASHIR
				(nodding)
			It's mutated into an airborne variety.

				(speaking for all)
			Which means?

					BASHIR
			Which means the whole station is

37   INT. ACCESS TUNNEL (SAME LOCATION AS TEASER)

	Kira and a repair crew are carefully rechecking every inch

38   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	The ALIEN DEVICE we saw in the teaser is now resting on
	Sisko's table.

38A  WIDEN TO INCLUDE

	Sisko and Kira.

					KIRA
			I found it inside the replicator's
			pattern generator.

					SISKO
			O'Brien must have accidently triggered
			it when he repaired the system.

					KIRA
			According to Bashir, it introduced
			an anomalous programming sequence
			into the materialization subroutine.
			In effect it built the virus directly
			into the replicated food at a
			molecular level.

					SISKO
			So what we have here is sabotage.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT THREE           30.

38A  CONTINUED:

					KIRA

					SISKO
			How can you be sure?

	Kira picks up the device and slowly turns it over in her

					KIRA
			It has a diboridium core for a power

	He drapes his arm around Jake's shoulder and leads him toward

					BASHIR
			Commander, when you have a moment...
			I've found something I'd like to

	Sisko nods and EXITS with Jake.

41   INT. HOSPITAL WARD

	Transformed into what at first glance resembles a refugee
	camp.  Aphasic victims are scattered throughout the room,
	many seated on cots that have been set up along the walls.
	Volunteer nurses (including Nurse Jabara) patrol the area,
	communicating with the patients by gesture and body language.

42   ANGLE ON SISKO AND JAKE

	and they ENTER.  Sisko spots Quark struggling to make himself
	understood to an N.D. Bajoran seated on a cot.

					QUARK
			Money... hand... mine... give.

					SISKO
			Well, Quark, I see even you couldn't
			weasel your way clear of this one.

	Quark straightens up and flashes a self-satisfied grin.

					QUARK
			You underestimate the Ferengi immune

	He turns back to the Bajoran patient.

					QUARK
			You... gold... owe... me.

43   NEW ANGLE

	as Sisko leads Jake deeper into the room.  At first they
	both are hesitant, this place looks pretty grim, but they
	lighten up when they notice O'Brien and Dax who approach.
	Sisko and Dax exchange rueful smiles.

					SISKO
				(simply)
			We're doing everything possible.

	And though Dax and the others can't understand the words,
	Sisko's concern comes through loud and clear.

	Dax holds out a comforting hand to Jake.  He looks over at
	Sisko who leans over and kisses him on the head.

44   INT. INFIRMARY

	Bashir directs Sisko over to a wall monitor... activates the
	screen.  An Okudagram of a DNA sequence appears on the
	monitor.

					BASHIR
			The virus is synthetic, Commander.
			Its nucleotide sequence is too
			perfect.  It's clearly not natural.

					SISKO
			You're saying the Cardassians
			genetically engineered this thing?

					BASHIR
			That's what I thought at first.  But
			I've studied Cardassian genetic
			engineering.  They always build
			distinctive monoclonial links into
			their DNA.  This virus has none of
			those features.

					SISKO
			All right, then who made it.

					BASHIR
				(enthusiasm rising)
			That's what I wanted to find out.
			So I referenced all known DNA
			construction techniques in the
			Federation records...

	Indicates a section of the DNA.

					BASHIR
			This protein series was the key.  It
			indicates that...

					SISKO
				(enough already)
			Doctor, who created this virus?

					BASHIR
			The Bajorans, sir.  I believe this
			must have been a terrorist plot to
			sabotage the Cardassians while they

	Off Sisko's surprised reaction...

45   INT. COMMANDER'S OFFICE

	Sisko, Kira, and Odo.  Kira is holding the Cardassian
	programming device.

					KIRA
			The energy decay of this power core
			indicates that it dates back to the
			building of the station.

					ODO
			That's eighteen years ago.  I suppose
			the Bajoran underground could have
			smuggled it aboard during
			construction.
				(a beat)
			Before I took over as head of
			security.

					SISKO
			But why would the underground go to
			all the trouble of planting a booby
			trap and then not set it off?

	Good question.

					ODO
			Maybe they forgot.

					KIRA
			More likely they were captured or
			killed before they could release it.

					SISKO
			We need to find out who created the
			virus.
				(to Kira)
			You're our best hope.

	Kira nods, knowing she has her work cut out for her.

					KIRA
			Eighteen years is a long time.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/19/92 - ACT THREE           36.

					ODO
			Besides, even if she finds this
			person... that's no guarantee he can
			help us.

					SISKO
			We just have to hope he remembers
			the antidote.

					ODO
			That's assuming he ever bothered to
			create one.

	That leaves them all with something to think about.

46   INT. OPS - CLOSE ON KIRA

	standing in front of a monitor at Dax's station.  GALIS BLIN,
	a middle aged Bajoran woman is on the screen.  (In b.g. we

					KIRA
			... Had to be someone in the

					GALIS
				(thinks for a beat)
			Eighteen years ago... sounds like

					KIRA
			How can I find him?

					GALIS
				(thinking)
			Last I heard he was in a Cardassian
			prison.

					KIRA
			Where was he being held?

					GALIS
			The Velos Seven Internment Camp.

			Can he be stabilized?

					BASHIR
			He hasn't responded to neural

			Look, I understand you're frightened.

	But before Odo can step off the pad --

					QUARK
				(working panel)
			Energizing.

87   ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Odo DEMATERIALIZES.

88   INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo appears out of the smoke pouring through an open airlock
	(we do not see him MATERIALIZE).

88A  INT. OPS

	Quark crosses over to take Odo's place at the operations
	table.

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Kira to Ops.  Approaching landing
			pad seven.  Request clearance to
			initiate docking procedure.

					QUARK
			Welcome back Major.  I could use
			some help up here.

					KIRA'S COM VOICE
			Quark what are you doing in Ops?

88B  INT. INFIRMARY

	as Kira, looking pale, ENTERS with Surmak.

					SURMAK
			First thing I need to see is your
			Doctors' viral characterization
			research.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/13/92 - ACT FIVE           56E.

88B  CONTINUED:

	He seats himself at a wall monitor.  He taps the console and
	the monitor displays Bashir's notes.

					SURMAK
				(scans data)
			He was beginning to develop an
			antidote series.  Let's take a look
			at that.

	Kira dabs at her forehead.  Her hand comes away damp with
	sweat.

					KIRA
			I'll be in Ops.  If you need me use
			the string...

	Surmak looks at her oddly.  She hesitates, confusion lining
	her face.

					KIRA
			... impact lots show red intense.

					SURMAK
			I think you'd better sit down, Major.

	He helps her to a seat then turns back to the monitor.

88C  INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo makes his way through the smoke.  We HEAR A GROAN O.S.

89   ODO'S POV

	Jaheel, having escaped from his ship, lies half conscious on
	the floor.

90   RESUME SCENE

	Odo lifts him up.

					JAHEEL
				(aphasic)
			Dog fellow distance.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/22/92 - ACT FIVE            57.

					ODO
			Tell me about it.

	He lifts Jaheel.

91   INT. OPS - TIGHT ON QUARK AT OPERATIONS TABLE

	Starting to feel the pressure, as he checks a console.

					QUARK
			Odo, that ship's going to explode in
			one minute.

92   INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo carries Jaheel to safety, then continues on his mission.

92A  INT. INFIRMARY

	Surmak, scanning the monitor, keeps up a running commentary
	for Kira.  She doesn't understand a word but she watches him
	intently, hoping for some sign of success.

					SURMAK
				(scanning info)
			Virum protein sheath... uh-huh...
			Nucleotide sequence... yes...
				(remembers)
			That's right, it's an adaptive
			synaptic inhibitor... Dekon was
			brilliant, there's no doubt of that.

	He continues to work.

92B  INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo over to the wall near the airlock, searches for the
	correct access panel.

					QUARK'S COM VOICE
			Forty seconds.

	Odo finds the panel, tears it open... Reveals a lever in an
	upright position.  Odo slams it down.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE           57A.

93   INT. OPS

	If Ferengis do indeed have hearts, then Quark's is banging

	out of his chest.

					QUARK
			Thirty seconds.  Hurry.

94   INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo crossing through the smoke to the other side of the
	airlock, heaves open another access panel... flips down
	another lever.

95   INT. OPS - QUARK

	Assuming a defensive position know as the Ferengi cringe.

					QUARK
			Twenty seconds.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE            58.

96   INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo doubletimes it through the smoke.

					ODO
				(muttering)
			I know.  I know.

	He arrives at a control panel... presses a button, the airlock
	doors close... He quickly punches in a code sequence... braces
	himself against the wall.  We HEAR THE SOUND OF THE MOORING
	CLAMPS EXPLODING.

97   EXT. DOCKING PORT FIVE (OPTICAL)

	Blown free of the clamps, Jaheel's ship is pushed clear of
	the docking port.

98   INT. OPS

	Quark prays to whatever God Ferengis pray to as he and Sisko
	are jolted by the blast.

99   OMITTED

100  INT. OPS

	As the shaking subsides... Quark gets to his feet.

					QUARK
			Quark to Odo.  You still with us?

101  INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	As Odo picks himself up off the floor.

					ODO
			Try not to sound too disappointed.

102  INT. OPS

	Quark leaning comfortably back in Kira's chair.

					QUARK
			Now, about that little matter of my
			hazard pay...

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/16/92 - ACT FIVE            59.

103  INT. DOCKING PORT FIVE

	Odo's eyes narrow.  One of these days he's going to throttle
	that greedy rodent.

103A INT. INFIRMARY

	Kira and Surmak as before.

					SURMAK
				(confidence growing)
			Your doctor came very close to finding
			the antidote himself.  The answer is
			in a progressive base substitution.

	He gets up and crosses to an equipment drawer and takes out
	a twenty-fourth century syringe.

					SURMAK
				(to Kira)
			Now I just need to take a blood
			sample.

	And as he begins to draw Kira's blood...

104  EXT. SPACE - DEEP SPACE NINE (OPTICAL)

					SISKO (V.O.)
			Station log, Stardate 46425.8.  We're
			continuing to administer Doctor
			Surmak's antidote throughout the
			station.  Things are slowly returning
			to normal.

            DEEP SPACE: "Babel" REV. 10/14/92 - ACT FIVE            60.

105  INT. OPS

	Fully staffed... Business as usual.  Sisko, Dax, Kira and
	O'Brien all at their stations.  Sisko crosses to the
	replicator.  Passes O'Brien.

					SISKO
			Good to have you back, Chief.

					O'BRIEN
			Thank you, sir.

106  ON O'BRIEN

	He sees where Sisko's headed, and a look of panic crosses
	his face.

					SISKO (O.S.)
			Hot coffee, black.

107  RESUME SCENE

	Sisko, cup in hand, takes a big gulp... And nearly gags.
	The coffee's awful -- again.

					SISKO
			O'Brien... !

	All eyes turn to O'Brien.  And as O'Brien's eyes turn to the
	heavens, we...

									FADE OUT.

                            THE END
